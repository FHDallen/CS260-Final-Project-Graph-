Description:\
 This program defines a graph data structure with various functionalities. \
 The graph consists of nodes (vertices) and edges with weights. It supports \
 adding vertices and edges, performing depth-first search (DFS), finding the \
 shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm, and finding the \
 minimum spanning tree (MST) using Kruskal's algorithm. 



Per Project Guidelines on Moodle: 

1.) A graph structure can be used to represent a network of cities and the \
roads connecting them. Each city will be a vertex, and each road will be an \
edge with a weight representing the distance between the cities. This graph \
structure can be used to solve problems like finding the shortest path \
between two cities or constructing the minimum spanning tree to connect all \
cities with the minimum total road length.
