 * Program: Graph.cpp
 * Name: Dylan Allen
 * Class: CS260
 * Professor: Joseph Jess
 * 
 * 
 * Description:
 * This program defines a graph data structure with various functionalities. 
 * The graph consists of nodes (vertices) and edges with weights. It supports 
 * adding vertices and edges, performing depth-first search (DFS), finding the 
 * shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm, and finding the 
 * minimum spanning tree (MST) using Kruskal's algorithm. The program also 
 * includes test cases to demonstrate these functionalities.
